README: How to Use the Python Code for Populating Meet/Athelete data into an HTML Template
This Python script reads meet results from a CSV file and populates them into a pre-defined HTML template, allowing you to create a web page that displays team and athlete information for a specific meet.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x installed on your machine.
A CSV file containing the meet data (team results, athlete details, etc.).
An HTML template file that includes placeholders for dynamic data insertion (like {{meet_name}}, {{team_rows}}, etc.).

Step-by-Step Guide (using Meet as an example):
Download the Required Files: Ensure you have the following files:

CSV File: This should have your meet/athelete data (e.g., your_data.csv).
HTML Template: An HTML file with placeholders for meet information (e.g., meet_template.html).
Update File Paths in the Script: Update the following file paths in the script:

Run the Python Script:
Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where your Python script is located.
Run the script by executing the following command:

python your_python_script.py


Generated HTML File: After running the script, an HTML file will be generated with the name you specified (e.g., meet1.html). This file will include all the populated data for the meet, such as team and athlete results.

Example Output:
The generated HTML file will include a structured webpage showing:

Meet name and date.
A table with team results (places, team names, scores).
A table with athlete results (places, names, times).
Conclusion:
This script automates the process of generating a meet results webpage by reading data from a CSV file and inserting it into an HTML template. You can modify the CSV data and HTML template to suit different meet formats or design preferences.
